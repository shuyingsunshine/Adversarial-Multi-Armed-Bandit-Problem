# Adversarial-Multi-Armed-Bandit-Problem

This is a project of studying adversarial multi armed bandit model, for the data mining course.

A multi-armed bandit problem is a sequential decision problem. At each time, an action is taken and some payoff is obtained. The goal is to maximize the total payoff obtained in a sequence of actions. The name bandit refers to the colloquial term for a slot machine. In a casino, the sequential decision problem faced by the player is to decide where to insert the next coin, when facing many slot machines.

Bandit problems are basic instances of sequential decision making with limited information, and address the fundamental tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in sequential experiments.
